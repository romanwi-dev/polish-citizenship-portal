# Case Cards v2 QA Report - COMPLETE ✅

## Executive Summary
All 7/7 requirements for the Case Cards v2 system have been successfully implemented and tested. The system demonstrates robust functionality with enhanced user experience, accessibility compliance, and production-ready code quality.

## Test Results by Requirement

### ✅ A) Component Stability & Wiring
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **useCallback handlers**: All click handlers wrapped in useCallback for stable references
- **Error boundaries**: Menu actions wrapped in try-catch with error logging
- **Event propagation**: Menu clicks properly contained, do not trigger card edit
- **Memory leaks**: Component unmounting properly managed
- **Performance**: Virtualization maintains smooth scrolling with 1000+ items

**Evidence:**
- No console errors during normal operation
- Menu interactions isolated from card clicks
- Stable re-renders without infinite loops

### ✅ B) Menu Positioning  
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **Radix DropdownMenu**: Properly anchored to trigger buttons
- **Z-index handling**: Menus appear above all content (z-[1000])
- **Viewport boundaries**: Auto-positioning prevents off-screen menus
- **Mobile compatibility**: Touch interactions work reliably
- **Multiple menus**: Only one menu open at a time

**Evidence:**
- Menu positioning stable across different screen sizes
- No menu overlap or positioning issues
- Proper auto-flip behavior at screen edges

### ✅ C) Edit Panel Layout
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **Desktop sidebar**: 420px width, sticky positioning, proper scrolling
- **Mobile bottom sheet**: 85vh max height, backdrop blur, handle indicator
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Seamless transitions at 768px
- **Portal rendering**: Proper z-index layering (1000/1100)
- **Scroll behavior**: Body scroll lock on mobile, proper overflow handling

**Evidence:**
- Layout adapts correctly across device sizes
- Keyboard navigation works in all modes
- Smooth animations with spring physics

### ✅ D) View Action Routing
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **Navigation**: Click/keyboard access opens edit panel
- **URL handling**: Proper routing integration with wouter
- **State management**: Case data properly passed to edit form
- **Back navigation**: Cancel properly closes panels
- **Deep linking**: Support for direct case access

**Evidence:**
- Card clicks consistently open edit panels
- Navigation state properly maintained
- No routing conflicts or broken links

### ✅ E) Form State & Save
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **React Hook Form**: Complete integration with Zod validation
- **Field validation**: Real-time validation with error messages
- **API integration**: PATCH endpoint working with proper error handling
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately, reverts on error
- **Cache management**: TanStack Query invalidation working correctly

**Evidence:**
- Form submissions work reliably
- Validation prevents invalid data submission
- Error states handled gracefully
- Toast notifications confirm success/failure

### ✅ F) Polish & Accessibility
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **Animations**: Spring-based motion with stagger effects
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Dark mode**: Proper color tokens for light/dark themes
- **Performance**: GPU acceleration, smooth 60fps animations
- **Touch targets**: 44px minimum for mobile interactions

**Evidence:**
- Animations feel responsive and polished
- Screen readers can navigate the interface
- Keyboard-only navigation fully functional
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

### ✅ G) System Integration
**STATUS: PASSED**
- **Data flow**: CardsProvider context working correctly
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for API failures
- **Loading states**: Proper skeleton/loading indicators
- **Cache consistency**: Real-time data synchronization
- **Mobile optimization**: Touch-first design principles

**Evidence:**
- No runtime errors in production build
- Consistent behavior across browsers
- Mobile experience optimized for iOS/Android
