1. **Clears all caches** before testing
2. **Tests every page and workflow** comprehensively  
3. **Reports issues immediately** with detailed logs
4. **Auto-fixes minor issues** when possible
5. **Generates detailed reports** with recommendations

## 📊 Test Results Dashboard

Open the visual dashboard to see:
- ✅ Real-time test status
- 📈 Performance metrics  
- ⚠️ Current issues and fixes
- 🎯 Coverage reports
- 📱 Mobile vs Desktop results

## 🤖 AI-Powered Features

### Natural Language Testing
Instead of complex selectors, tests use plain English:
```javascript
await ai('Click the theme toggle button');
await ai('Fill the citizenship form with Polish ancestry data');
await ai('Upload passport document and verify OCR extraction');
await ai('Generate PDF and confirm download works');
```
