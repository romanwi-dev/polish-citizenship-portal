# Section Content Mapping (Current State)

## Current Problem:
- Section 1 (Applicant) has document upload content (should have client details forms)
- Section 2 (Tree) has client details forms (should have family tree)  
- Section 3 (Documents) has family tree content (should have document upload)

## Solution: Swap content blocks to match headers
