      userQuery: "How can I get Polish citizenship if my grandparents were Polish?",
      aiResponse: "If your grandparents were Polish citizens after 1920 and maintained their citizenship when your parent was born, you may be eligible for Polish citizenship by descent. This is based on the principle of jus sanguinis (right of blood). The process typically takes 2-4 years and costs €3,500-12,500 depending on complexity. You'll need to prove the unbroken chain of Polish citizenship through documentation."
    },
    {
      userQuery: "What's the difference between Polish citizenship by descent and naturalization?",
      aiResponse: "Polish citizenship by descent (jus sanguinis) is for people with Polish ancestry who can prove their ancestor was a Polish citizen after 1920. It's not naturalization - you're claiming citizenship you already have by birth right. Naturalization requires living in Poland for several years. Citizenship by descent is faster for eligible applicants and doesn't require residency or language tests."
